          subtitle: "Hello! I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University. I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ã‰va Tardos](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/) and [Prof. Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/), and be supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). My research interests span algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, and optimization, particularly with more realistic models of behavioral and cognitive constraints. Recently, I've been thinking about matching markets with biased and  malleable preferences.

<br><br>
Previously, I graduated from Princeton University with an A.B. in Chemistry and minors in Applied Math and Computer Science, where I worked with [Prof. Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) on Bayesian auction design for multi-item revenue maximization. I also wrote my senior thesis in physical organic chemistry under the supervision of [Prof. Robert Knowles](https://knowleslab.princeton.edu/).

Non-academic interests (many starting with a C and supported by images): caffeine, cats, colouring-of-hair, [crafting](https://www.instagram.com/egg.t.arts/), dance, yoga"
