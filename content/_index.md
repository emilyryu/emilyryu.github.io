Hello! I'm a fifth-year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University. I'm very fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Ã‰va Tardos**](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/) and [**Prof. Jon Kleinberg**](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/), and be supported by the [**NSF GRFP**](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). My research interests span algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, learning theory, and optimization, particularly with more realistic models of behavioral and cognitive constraints. Recently, I've been thinking about matching markets with biased and malleable preferences.
<br><br>
Previously, I graduated from Princeton University with an A.B. in Chemistry and minors in Applied Math and Computer Science, where I worked with [**Prof. Matt Weinberg**](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) on Bayesian auction design for multi-item revenue maximization.

Non-academic interests (many starting with a C and supported by images): [**caffeine**](/coffee.jpg), [**cats**](/pokki.jpg), [**colouring-of-hair**](/colouring.jpg), [**crafting**](https://www.instagram.com/egg.t.arts/), dance, yoga

**I'm on the postdoc job market for the 2025-2026 cycle!** Please see my CV below, and feel free to get in contact.
